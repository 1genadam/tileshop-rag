# NEPQ Scoring System - Comprehensive Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive NEPQ (Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questioning) scoring system that provides real-time performance analysis for AI sales agents. This system offers continuous improvement tracking similar to how we achieved 4/4 performance on AOS methodology.

## üìä Scoring Framework

### 7-Stage NEPQ Performance Metrics (10-Point Scale Each)

1. **Connection Stage (1/7)** - Status positioning and disarmament
2. **Problem Awareness (2/7)** - Current state challenge identification  
3. **Consequence Discovery (3/7)** - Cost of inaction exploration
4. **Solution Awareness (4/7)** - Ideal criteria and future state visualization
5. **Qualifying Questions (5/7)** - Importance and readiness assessment
6. **Objection Handling (6/7)** - 3-step formula execution (Clarify ‚Üí Discuss ‚Üí Diffuse)
7. **Commitment Stage (7/7)** - Next steps and specific actions

### Overall Performance Grades
- **A+ (90-100)**: Excellent - Mastery level performance
- **A (80-89)**: Very Good - Strong consistent execution  
- **B (70-79)**: Good - Solid fundamentals with room for improvement
- **C (60-69)**: Acceptable - Basic competency, needs focus
- **D (50-59)**: Needs Improvement - Significant gaps
- **F (0-49)**: Poor - Requires comprehensive training

## ü§ñ Real-Time Analysis Features

### Automatic Performance Tracking
- **Live Scoring**: Every conversation automatically generates NEPQ scores
- **Stage Breakdown**: Individual scores for each of the 7 NEPQ stages
- **Conversation Metrics**: Questions asked, objections encountered/resolved
- **Progress Visualization**: Color-coded performance indicators (üü¢üü°üî¥)

### Self-Analysis Reports
