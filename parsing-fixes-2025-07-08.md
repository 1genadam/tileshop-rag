# Tileshop Product Parsing Fixes - July 8, 2025

## Issues Resolved

Fixed critical parsing issues where product specifications were not being extracted from Tileshop product pages, specifically:

1. **Edge Type** - Previously showing null, now correctly extracts "Rectified"
2. **Box Quantity** - Previously showing null, now correctly extracts numeric values like "6"  
3. **Product Category** - Previously showing null, now correctly extracts "Tile" from product titles
4. **Material Type** - Already working, enhanced validation to prevent future issues

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Incorrect JSON Pattern Matching**: Tileshop uses `{"Key":"PDPInfo_FieldName","Value":"actual_value"}` structure
2. **Overly Strict Validation**: Valid data like "Rectified" was being filtered as corrupted due to broad pattern `'ed'`
3. **Missing Database Fields**: `product_category` was extracted but not included in INSERT/UPDATE statements
4. **URL Processing Logic**: Previously processed URLs marked as "completed" were being skipped during re-processing

## Technical Changes Made

### enhanced_specification_extractor.py
- **Fixed Box Quantity patterns**: Added correct JSON pattern `r'"Key"\s*:\s*"PDPInfo_BoxQuantity"[^}]*"Value"\s*:\s*"([^"]+)"'`
- **Fixed Edge Type patterns**: Added correct JSON pattern `r'"Key"\s*:\s*"PDPInfo_EdgeType"[^}]*"Value"\s*:\s*"([^"]+)"'`
- **Fixed Material Type patterns**: Added correct JSON pattern `r'"Key"\s*:\s*"PDPInfo_MaterialType"[^}]*"Value"\s*:\s*"([^"]+)"'`
- **Removed problematic validation**: Removed overly broad `'ed'` pattern from corrupted data filters
- **Added validation bypasses**: Valid edge types and product categories now bypass corruption filtering
- **Added product category extraction**: `_extract_category_from_title()` method extracts categories from product titles
- **Enhanced trim detection**: Added comprehensive trim keywords (GL, Great Lakes, L-channel, round edge, box edge, Somerset, Durand)

### tileshop_learner.py
- **Added product title parameter**: Pass product title to `extract_specifications()` for category extraction
- **Enhanced field mappings**: Added direct mappings for `box_quantity`, `edge_type`, `product_category`
- **Fixed database schema**: Added `product_category` to INSERT and UPDATE statements
- **Ensured proper field handling**: All extracted fields now properly saved to database

## Testing Results

Verified with SKU 684287 (Marmi Imperiali Zenobia Porcelain Wall and Floor Tile):

**Before:**
```sql
sku | edge_type | product_category | box_quantity | material_type
684287 |         |                  |              | porcelain
```

**After:**
```sql
sku | edge_type | product_category | box_quantity | material_type  
684287 | Rectified | Tile             |            6 | porcelain
```

## Documentation Updates

- **Updated ACQUISITION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Added comprehensive section for "Product Fields Not Parsing" with step-by-step troubleshooting guide
- **Added parsing patterns examples**: Documented correct JSON structures and validation logic
- **Included verification steps**: SQL queries and testing procedures for future troubleshooting

## Validation Process

To ensure existing products get updated with fixed parsing:

1. **Reset URL status**: Change `scrape_status` from "completed" to "pending" in sitemap
2. **Re-process products**: Run `python acquire_from_sitemap.py 1` to test single product
3. **Verify database**: Check that all fields are properly populated
4. **Batch processing**: Can now safely run full acquisition with corrected parsing

## Impact

- **Immediate**: SKU 684287 and similar products now show complete specification data
- **Future**: All new product acquisitions will correctly extract Edge Type, Box Quantity, and Product Category
- **System reliability**: Reduced false positive corruption filtering
- **Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive documentation for future similar issues
