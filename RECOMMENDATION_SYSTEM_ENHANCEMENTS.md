# Recommendation System Enhancements Documentation

## Overview

The Recommendation System Enhancements integrate expert installation knowledge with the Tileshop RAG system to provide comprehensive project recommendations based on complete installation thinking methodology.

## Expert Knowledge Integration

### Core Philosophy: Complete Project Thinking

The enhanced recommendation system moves beyond simple product matching to provide comprehensive project guidance based on professional installation expertise:

1. **Substrate Preparation** - Foundation for long-term success
2. **Waterproofing Systems** - Critical moisture protection
3. **Material Compatibility** - Ensures all components work together
4. **Installation Sequences** - Professional step-by-step guidance
5. **Quality Assurance** - Long-term performance optimization

## Enhanced Product Recommendation Features

### 1. Expert Installation Knowledge Integration

**Wood Plank Tile Installation Example**:
```python
# Expert installation sequence
installation_sequence = [
    "Substrate preparation and leveling",
    "Waterproofing system installation", 
    "Layout and planning",
    "Tile installation with proper adhesive",
    "Grouting and sealing",
    "Final inspection and cleanup"
]

# Critical considerations
critical_considerations = [
    "Proper substrate preparation prevents future failures",
    "Waterproofing is essential for wet areas",
    "Layout planning prevents awkward cuts",
    "Proper adhesive selection for substrate type"
]
```

### 2. Heated Floor Installation Expertise

**Basement-Specific Requirements**:
- **Cable Spacing**: 2 spaces apart (increased heat diffusion)
- **Standard Spacing**: 3-4 spaces apart
- **Wall Clearance**: 6-8 inches from walls (code requirement)
- **Furniture Restrictions**: No cables under benches, tables, couches
- **Critical Tools**: Plastic trowel to protect cables from damage

**Component Requirements**:
```python
heated_components = {
    'heated_mat': 'Electric heated floor mat',
    'thermostat': 'Thermostat with sensor wire',
    'protective_trowel': 'Plastic trowel (cable protection)',
    'quarter_trowel': '1/4 inch trowel (under mat)',

    f"**{product['title']}** (SKU: {product['sku']})\n"
    f"**Price:** ${product['price']:.2f} | "
    f"**Page:** https://www.tileshop.com/product/{product['sku']}\n"
    f"{product_description}\n"
)
```

### Complete Project Cost Calculations

```python
# Comprehensive cost breakdown
cost_breakdown = {
    "materials": project.estimated_cost,
    "labor": project.estimated_cost * 0.6,    # 60% of materials
    "tools": project.estimated_cost * 0.1,    # 10% of materials  
    "misc": project.estimated_cost * 0.05,    # 5% miscellaneous
    "total": sum(all_costs)
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Material Needs Calculation

```python

    """Calculate complete project materials with expert knowledge"""
    
    # Detect project specifics
    is_basement = room_type == 'basement' or 'basement' in room_type.lower()
    is_heated = 'heated' in room_type.lower()
    is_shower = room_type in ['bathroom', 'shower']
    
    # Expert waterproofing system
    if is_shower:
        waterproofing_system = {
            'wedi_tape': {
                'item': 'Wedi Subliner Dry Waterproof Sealing Tape',
                'sku': '348968',

            }
        }
    
    # Heated floor system with basement modifications
    if is_heated:
        heating_spacing = "2 spaces apart" if is_basement else "3-4 spaces apart"
        heated_components = {
            'heated_mat': {
                'note': f'Cable spacing: {heating_spacing} for heat diffusion'
