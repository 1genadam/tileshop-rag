## üîß Technical Implementation Summary

### **Core Architecture Enhancements**

#### **1. Enhanced System Prompt (`modules/simple_tile_agent.py:35-124`)**
```python
# Professional AOS methodology with mandatory sequence enforcement
MANDATORY CONVERSATION FLOW - MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT SEQUENCE:
1Ô∏è‚É£ GREETING & CREDIBILITY (Target: 4/4)
2Ô∏è‚É£ NEEDS ASSESSMENT - THE FOUR MANDATORY QUESTIONS (Target: 4/4)
3Ô∏è‚É£ DESIGN & DETAILS - PROFESSIONAL CONSULTATION (Target: 4/4)
4Ô∏è‚É£ THE CLOSE - DIRECT ASK FOR BUSINESS (Target: 4/4)
```

#### **2. Auto-Sequence Implementation (`modules/simple_tile_agent.py:726-762`)**
```python
# AUTO-SEQUENCE: After successful product search, automatically proceed to calculations and close
if result.get('success', True):
    # Extract dimensions ‚Üí AUTO-CALCULATE ‚Üí AUTO-CLOSE
    calc_result = self.calculate_project_requirements(dimensions_match)
    close_result = self.attempt_close(project_summary, "next week", "availability")
```

#### **3. Validation Logic Enhancement (`modules/simple_tile_agent.py:270-327`)**
```python
def validate_aos_requirements(self, conversation_history: List[Dict], intended_action: str):
    # Check mandatory requirements: name, dimensions, budget, installation, timeline
    # Block product search until ALL requirements collected
    # Track product search completion for proper sequence enforcement
```

#### **4. Professional Calculation Engine (`modules/simple_tile_agent.py:383-450`)**
```python
def calculate_project_requirements(self, dimensions: str, tile_size: str = "12x12", 
                                 tile_price: float = 4.99, pattern: str = "straight"):
    # Waste factors: straight (10%), diagonal (15%), complex (20%)
    # Professional material calculations with complete cost breakdown
```

#### **5. Closing System (`modules/simple_tile_agent.py:451-485`)**
```python
def attempt_close(self, project_summary: str, timeline: str = "soon", 
                 urgency_reason: str = "availability"):
    # Direct close techniques with urgency creation
    # Professional value proposition and next steps
```

### **Testing Framework Enhancement**
- **Enhanced compliance detection** for tool-based closes (`test_aos_performance.py:208-218`)
- **Systematic AOS phase testing** against sample conversation standards
- **Automated performance scoring** with detailed feedback
