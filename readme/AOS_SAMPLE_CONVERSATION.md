## **NEEDS ASSESSMENT - THE FOUR MANDATORY QUESTIONS (Score: 4/4)**

**CUSTOMER:** We're looking for bathroom tile.

**SALESPERSON:** Perfect! Bathroom projects are some of my favorites - they can really make your daily routine so much more enjoyable. To make sure I recommend the absolute best solution for you, Sarah, let me understand your project through four key areas that I cover with every customer:

**WHAT - Project Understanding:**
First, tell me about the specific areas you're tiling. Are you doing the floor, walls, or both? And what are the dimensions of your bathroom?

**CUSTOMER:** We want to do the floor and a backsplash behind the vanity.

**SALESPERSON:** Excellent! Can you give me the measurements? For the floor, what's the length and width? And for the backsplash, the length and height?

**CUSTOMER:** The floor is about 8 feet by 10 feet, and the backsplash area is about 6 feet long and 4 feet high.

**SALESPERSON:** Perfect, let me write that down. So we're looking at 80 square feet for the floor and 24 square feet for backsplash. Now, what color scheme are you working with? Do you have countertops and cabinets picked out?

**CUSTOMER:** Yeah, we're looking at black countertops with white cabinets.

**SALESPERSON:** That's a stunning combination - very modern and timeless. 

**WHO - Installation and Decision Making:**
Second question - who's planning to do the installation? Are you doing this yourself, or will you be working with a contractor?

**CUSTOMER:** We have a contractor - Rachel at Lazarus Home Remodeling.

**SALESPERSON:** Great! I know Rachel - she does excellent work. Are you and your husband the final decision makers on the tile selection, or does anyone else need to approve this?

**CUSTOMER:** No, it's just us two making the decision.

**WHEN - Timeline:**
Third, when are you hoping to start this project, and do you have a target completion date?

**CUSTOMER:** We're hoping to start in the next week or two.

**SALESPERSON:** Perfect timing! That gives us plenty of lead time to get your materials ready. When would you ideally like the project completed?

**CUSTOMER:** Probably within the next month.

**SALESPERSON:** Excellent timeline for a bathroom renovation.

## **DESIGN & DETAILS - TILE BOMB & CONSULTATION (Score: 4/4)**

**SALESPERSON:** Based on everything you've told me - your modern black and white color scheme, the 8x10 bathroom floor, slip-resistant needs, and contractor installation - I have three tiles that I think will be absolutely perfect for your project.

Let me show you what I call a "tile bomb" - these are my top recommendations specifically for your project:

**Option 1: Carrara Marble Look Porcelain 12x24 - SKU #CM2412**
- This gives you that classic marble veining that works beautifully with your color scheme
- Perfect contrast with black countertops and white cabinets
- Slip-resistant matte finish for safety
- Premium porcelain that's easy to maintain

**Option 2: Warm Gray Stone Look 12x12 - SKU #WG1212**
- Beautiful warm undertones with subtle veining
- Very popular for modern bathrooms
- Easy maintenance porcelain
- Mid-range investment option

**Option 3: Cream Travertine Look 18x18 - SKU #CT1818**
- Warm cream tones with natural stone texture
- Larger format means fewer grout lines
- Coordinates beautifully with your color scheme
- Premium option with luxury feel

Which of these feels right for your vision, Sarah?

**CUSTOMER:** I really like the first one - the marble look. That sounds perfect.

**SALESPERSON:** Excellent choice! The Carrara Marble Look is our most popular bathroom tile for exactly your style. It's going to look absolutely stunning with your black countertops and white cabinets. 

**HOW MUCH - Budget Parameters:**
Now, do you have a budget range in mind for the tile portion of this project? This helps me make sure we're aligned on your investment level.

**CUSTOMER:** We're not really sure... maybe around $800 to $1,200?

**SALESPERSON:** That's a perfect budget range that gives us some really beautiful options! Let me calculate exactly what you'll need for the Carrara Marble Look:

**QUANTITY CALCULATIONS:**
- Floor: 80 SF + 10% waste = 88 SF needed
- Backsplash: 24 SF + 10% waste = 26.4 SF needed  
- Total tile needed: 114.4 SF
- At $4.99 per SF: 114.4 × $4.99 = $570.86
- Boxes needed: 8 boxes (covers 124 SF total - gives you extra for future repairs)
- Tile cost: $570.86

Now, for the professional finishing touches, you'll need:
- Schluter edge trim for backsplash: $45
- Premium tile adhesive: $35
- Premium grout in Warm Gray: $25
- Grout sealer: $18

**Total project cost: $693.86 - well within your budget and leaves room for any unexpected needs!**

Sarah, this is going to transform your bathroom completely. Can you picture how elegant this will look?

**CUSTOMER:** Yes, that sounds really good!

## **THE CLOSE (Score: 4/4)**

**SALESPERSON:** I can see you're excited about this, Sarah! This Carrara Marble Look is going to create exactly the spa-like feeling you want in your bathroom. You've got Rachel lined up for installation, the timing works perfectly for your schedule, and we're right in your budget range.

Should we go ahead and get your order placed today? I can have all your materials ready for pickup by this weekend, which gives Rachel everything she needs to start on schedule.

**CUSTOMER:** Well... let me think about it for a day.

## **OBJECTION HANDLING (Score: 4/4)**

**SALESPERSON:** 
**1. Clarify:** Of course! This is an important decision. Help me understand - is there a specific aspect you'd like to think about? Is it the tile selection, the budget, or something else?

**CUSTOMER:** I just want to make sure my husband likes it too.

**SALESPERSON:** 
**2. Empathize:** I completely understand - you want to make sure you're both thrilled with this choice. This is going to be in your home for many years.

**3. Provide Solution:** Tell you what - let me print out this design mockup and the full quote for you to take home. That way your husband can see exactly what we've planned. Plus, I can hold this pricing for you through Friday. How does that sound?

**CUSTOMER:** That sounds good.

**SALESPERSON:** 
**4. Re-ask for Business:** Perfect! If he loves it as much as you do - which I'm confident he will - can we plan to finalize the order tomorrow or Thursday? That still gives us time to have everything ready for your timeline.

**CUSTOMER:** Yes, that should work.

## **FOLLOW-UP & DELIVERY (Score: 4/4)**

**SALESPERSON:** Excellent! Let me get your contact information and set up your customer account.

**CUSTOMER:** Sure, it's Sarah Johnson, and my phone is 847-302-2594.

**SALESPERSON:** Perfect, Sarah. I'm going to:
- Email you this complete quote and design today
- Call you Thursday afternoon to see how the conversation went
- Have your materials ready for pickup by Friday if you decide to move forward
- Coordinate directly with Rachel so she knows exactly what's coming

Do you have any questions about the installation process or timeline before we wrap up?
