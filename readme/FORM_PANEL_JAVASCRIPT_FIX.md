# Form Panel JavaScript Fix - Critical Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary
**Date**: July 16, 2025  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue Description
The form panel toggle button on the customer chat interface was not functioning. When users clicked the "Open Form Panel" button, it would throw a JavaScript error: `Uncaught ReferenceError: toggleFormPanel is not defined`.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a missing script tag in the `customer_chat.html` template. The external JavaScript file `/static/chat.js` containing the `toggleFormPanel()` function was not being loaded on the production site.

**Missing Script Tag**: `<script src="/static/chat.js"></script>`

### Technical Details

#### Files Affected
- `/Users/robertsher/Projects/tileshop_rag_prod/templates/customer_chat.html`
- `/Users/robertsher/Projects/tileshop_rag_prod/static/chat.js`

#### JavaScript Functions Not Loading
- `toggleFormPanel()` - Main form panel toggle function
- `testFormPanel()` - Debugging function
- Form panel event listeners and initialization code
- Console debugging messages with emoji indicators

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Added Missing Script Tag
**File**: `templates/customer_chat.html`  
**Location**: Before closing `</body>` tag

```html
<!-- Form Panel JavaScript -->
<script src="/static/chat.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### 2. Deployment
- Successfully deployed fix to production via Fly.io
- Build completed without errors
- Production URL: https://tileshop-rag.fly.dev/chat
