# Extraction Recovery Process Log
## Timeline of Data Extraction Issues

### üö® **Problem Identified**
- **Data Quality**: Only 1.49% of recent products have proper data extraction
- **Scope**: All products from July 2nd show null values for most fields
- **Root Cause**: Speed optimization broke data extraction pipeline

### üìÖ **Timeline Analysis**

#### **Current Status (July 2, 2025 - 4:00 PM)**
- Products scraped as recent as July 2nd 1:00-2:00 AM show null extraction
- All recent 605 products in database have insufficient data (< 10 populated fields)
- Only basic metadata working: SKU, URL, specifications, timestamp

#### **Commits Attempted for Reversion**

1. **115a5771** - "Implement real-time crawl feedback and 60-70% speed optimization"
   - **Date**: July 1, 2025 5:09 PM
   - **Issue**: Added CSS selectors that filtered out content
   - **Status**: ‚ùå Still broken

2. **ab408d2e** - "Update database schema and acquisition system" 
   - **Date**: July 1, 2025 11:07 PM
   - **Issue**: Major schema changes but extraction already broken
   - **Status**: ‚ùå Still broken

3. **284fe48b** - "Enhanced microservices health check system"
   - **Date**: Much earlier (pre-optimization)
   - **Status**: ‚è≥ Currently testing - acquisition running
   - **Note**: Using much simpler extraction logic

### üîß **Technical Changes Made**

#### **Speed Optimization Issues (115a5771)**
- Added restrictive CSS selectors: `.product-detail, .product-info, .product-specs, .product-title, .price`
- Reduced wait time: 15s ‚Üí 8s
- Added tag exclusions that may have removed important content
- **Result**: Content not captured properly

#### **Database Schema Changes (ab408d2e)**
- Added image and resource extraction fields
- Enhanced PDF and installation guide processing
- Added synchronous/asynchronous crawl handling
- **Result**: Good enhancements but extraction already broken

### üìã **Recovery Strategy**

#### **Phase 1: Find Working Baseline** ‚úÖ (In Progress)
- ‚úÖ Reverted to commit 284fe48b (much older, simpler logic)
- ‚è≥ Testing if basic extraction works with older code
- üéØ Goal: Get basic fields working (title, price, description, specifications)

#### **Phase 2: Quality Monitoring** ‚úÖ (Implemented)
- ‚úÖ Quality validation system active and monitoring
- ‚úÖ Dashboard alerts for extraction failures
- üéØ Goal: Real-time detection of extraction issues

#### **Phase 3: Gradual Enhancement** üìã (Planned)
- üìã Reapply database schema enhancements from ab408d2e
- üìã Add image and resource extraction
- üìã Implement PDF and installation guide collection
- üéØ Goal: Comprehensive data extraction with quality validation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Monitoring**

#### **Quality Metrics**
- **Total Recent Products**: 605 (last 24h)
- **High Quality**: 9 products (‚â•10 fields)
- **Poor Quality**: 596 products (<10 fields)
- **Success Rate**: 1.49% (CRITICAL)

#### **Acquisition Status**
- **Running Since**: 4:16 PM with older extraction logic
- **Progress**: 46.4% complete (2,218/4,777 products)
- **Expected**: New products should show improved extraction

### üéØ **Success Criteria**

#### **Immediate Goals (Next 1-2 hours)**
- [ ] New products processed with older logic show >10 populated fields
- [ ] Quality percentage increases above 60% for recent extractions
- [ ] Basic commerce data extracted: title, price, description, specifications

#### **Medium-term Goals (Next 24 hours)**
- [ ] Reapply database schema enhancements for images and resources
- [ ] Implement comprehensive data extraction with quality validation
- [ ] Achieve >80% quality rate for new extractions

### üìÅ **Documentation Created**
- ‚úÖ **DASHBOARD_IMPROVEMENTS_CATALOG.md** - Preserves all dashboard enhancements
- ‚úÖ **DATABASE_SCHEMA_ENHANCEMENTS.md** - Documents schema improvements to reapply
- ‚úÖ **EXTRACTION_RECOVERY_LOG.md** - This recovery process log

### ‚úÖ **Code Restoration Completed (July 2, 2025 - 5:40 PM)**
- **Status**: Restored to newest code version (HEAD)
- **Files Restored**: 
  - `acquire_from_sitemap.py` - Latest acquisition logic
  - `tileshop_learner.py` - Current extraction engine
  - `download_sitemap.py` - Sitemap management
- **Preserved**: All dashboard improvements and quality monitoring systems

### üöÄ **Next Steps**
1. **Test** Crawl4AI service health and configuration
2. **Analyze** current extraction logic in newest code version
3. **Identify** specific failures in data extraction pipeline
4. **Fix** crawler data extraction engine issues
5. **Validate** extraction works with latest code

### üéØ **Current Investigation Focus**
Now investigating why the newest code version has data extraction issues, focusing on:
- Crawl4AI service configuration and health
- Content extraction pipeline in `tileshop_learner.py`
- CSS selector restrictions and optimization impacts
- JSON-LD parsing and data structure extraction

This recovery process ensures we restore working data extraction while preserving all valuable dashboard improvements and preparing for enhanced data collection.
