# Parsing Monitor Log
**Learning Session Started:** July 03, 2025 - 11:22 PM
**Monitoring Status:** Active - No intervention until completion

## Current Progress Tracking
- **Start Time:** 11:22 PM
- **Initial Completed:** 5 URLs
- **Latest Check:** 10 URLs (as of 11:23 PM)
- **Processing Rate:** ~2-3 URLs per minute (slower than initial estimate)
- **Status:** Active processing continues

## Parsing Issues Detected

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Generic Title Problem**: All 65 recent products have identical generic title "The Tile Shop - High Quality Floor & Wall Tile"
2. **Missing Brand Data**: 0 out of 65 products have brand information extracted
3. **Missing Price Data**: 0 out of 65 products have any pricing information (price_per_box, price_per_sqft, price_per_piece)
4. **Limited Content Extraction**: Only SKU and generic categorization working properly

### Quality Check Results
- **Products Processed:** 65 URLs in last 24 hours
- **SKU Extraction:** 100% success (65/65)
- **Brand Extraction:** 0% success (0/65)
- **Price Extraction:** 0% success (0/65)
- **Proper Title Extraction:** 0% success (0/65)
- **Overall Quality Score:** CRITICAL - Major parsing system failure

## System Status
- ❌ **Enhanced parsing system FAILED** - Not extracting product data
- ❌ **JSON-LD priority extraction FAILED** - No structured data captured
- ❌ **Content extraction FAILED** - Only fallback categorization working
- ✅ Database schema with enhanced categorization applied
- ✅ SKU extraction working (only successful component)

## Root Cause Analysis
The intelligent parsing system appears to have failed completely. All enhanced extraction methods (JSON-LD, specialized parsers, enhanced content detection) are not functioning. The system is falling back to basic URL pattern matching for categorization but failing to extract actual product content.

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Investigate tileshop_learner.py crawler configuration
2. **Critical**: Check if specialized_parsers.py are being called correctly
3. **Urgent**: Verify JavaScript rendering and content loading detection
4. **Essential**: Test parsing system on a single URL to isolate failure point

## Monitoring Schedule
- **Check Frequency:** Every 10-15 minutes
- **Log Updates:** When parsing issues detected
- **Final Review:** After full sitemap completion
