Christopher Davis has positioned Tile Shop Holdings for digital transformation success, but **critical gaps remain in their customer experience and operational efficiency** that a RAG-based search system could strategically address. Despite achieving dramatic performance improvements from their Sitecore migration, Davis faces declining traffic, complex product discovery challenges, and competitive pressure from AI-powered rivals that demand innovative solutions.

## Davis's battle-tested technology philosophy and current pain points

Christopher Davis joined Tile Shop in October 2020 to address what he diagnosed as \"battle fatigue\" - an organization \"ready to use technology to grow and be successful, but they lacked the know-how.\" His systematic approach focuses on **people, processes, and technology** in that order, with customer-centric solutions driving three critical performance levers: **traffic, conversion, and average order value**.

**Key technology challenges Davis has specifically identified:**
- **\"Over dependence on ERP monolith\"** that prevented agile ecommerce operations
- **\"Slow engineering velocity\"** limiting rapid implementation of customer-facing improvements  
- **Marketing team \"dependence on IT\"** creating operational bottlenecks
- **Page load times of 14 seconds** before their transformation (now 2.7 seconds)
- **\"Disconnects and silos, undermining performance, productivity, results\"**

Davis emphasizes that \"the ROI had to be justifiable, with customer experience driving three levers: traffic, conversion, and average order value.\" This cost-benefit focus, combined with his \"business problem-solver\" philosophy, creates the perfect framework for RAG implementation.

## Critical gaps in current Sitecore implementation that RAG can solve

Despite successful migration to Sitecore XM Cloud, OrderCloud, and Discover, **significant functionality gaps remain** that directly impact customer experience:

**Search and discovery limitations:**
- Current Sitecore Discover relies primarily on keyword-based matching, struggling with semantic understanding of complex tile queries
- Limited ability to handle natural language product descriptions and technical specifications across **5,000+ SKUs from 40 countries**
- Poor cross-category product discovery despite extensive inventory
- Customers report difficulty finding specific tiles for complex projects

**Product catalog intelligence gaps:**
- Complex product data with multiple measurement units (square feet, pieces, boxes, pallets) creates confusion
- Inconsistent product attribute mapping across international suppliers
- Limited contextual understanding of product relationships and applications
- **Inadequate real-time inventory insights** across 142 stores

**Customer experience friction:**
- Despite performance improvements, customers still report **20+ minute checkout processes**
