```
\"Christopher, you've transformed Tile Shop from 14-second page loads 
to 2.7 seconds, but customers still report 20-minute checkout processes. 
Your three performance levers - traffic, conversion, and AOV - face 
new challenges as Home Depot and Lowe's deploy AI assistants that 
change customer expectations.\"
```
