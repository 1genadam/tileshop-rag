# Tile Specifications & Technical Glossary

## Water Absorption Classifications

Water absorption measures the internal porosity of tile and determines appropriate applications.

**Test Standards**: EN 99, ISO 10545-3, ASTM C373-88

### Classification Categories
1. **Low Dense**: >7% absorption
   - Higher porosity, more water absorption
   - Suitable for interior wall applications only
   - Not recommended for freeze-thaw environments

2. **Medium Dense**: 3-7% absorption
   - Moderate porosity
   - Suitable for most interior applications
   - Limited outdoor use in mild climates

3. **High Dense**: 0.5-3% absorption
   - Lower porosity, good durability
   - Suitable for most floor and wall applications
   - Can handle some moisture exposure

4. **Extremely Dense (Porcelain)**: <0.5% absorption
   - Minimal porosity, maximum durability
   - Suitable for all applications including high-moisture areas
   - Excellent for outdoor and commercial use

## Surface Abrasion (PEI Rating)

Classifies tile durability for different traffic levels and determines appropriate applications.

### PEI Rating Scale
- **PEI I**: Very light traffic
  - Wall applications only
  - Residential bathrooms (walls only)

- **PEI II**: Light traffic
  - Residential walls and light floor traffic
  - Bedrooms, bathrooms (residential)

- **PEI III**: Moderate traffic
  - All residential applications except kitchens, entrances, stairs
  - Most home interior floors

- **PEI IV**: Heavy traffic
  - All residential and light commercial applications
  - Kitchens, entrances, restaurants, offices

- **PEI V**: Heavy commercial traffic
  - All applications including heavy commercial
  - Shopping centers, airports, public buildings

## Resistance to Deep Abrasion (Mohs Hardness Scale)

Measures scratch resistance on a scale of 1-10.

### Hardness Scale Reference
- **1-2**: Very soft (talc, gypsum)
- **3-4**: Soft to medium (calcite, fluorite)
- **5-6**: Medium to hard (apatite, orthoclase)
- **7-8**: Hard (quartz, topaz)
- **9-10**: Very hard (corundum, diamond)

### Tile Application Guidelines
- **Mohs 5-6**: Suitable for most residential applications
- **Mohs 7+**: Excellent for high-traffic and commercial use
- **Mohs 8+**: Superior scratch resistance for demanding applications

## Frost Resistance

**Test Standards**: EN 202, ISO 10545-12

Determines suitability for outdoor and freeze-thaw applications.

### Test Conditions
- Temperature cycles from +51°C to -51°C
- Multiple freeze-thaw cycles
- Evaluates cracking, spalling, or deterioration

### Application Guidelines
- **Frost Resistant**: Suitable for outdoor applications
- **Not Frost Resistant**: Interior use only
- **Critical for**: Patios, pool decks, outdoor stairs, northern climates

## Stain Resistance

**Test Standards**: EN 122, ISO 10545-14

Measures surface's ability to resist and remove various stains.

### Classification Scale
- **Class 1**: Stain not removable
- **Class 2**: Stain removable with strong cleaning agents
- **Class 3**: Stain removable with mild cleaning agents
- **Class 4**: Stain removable with weak cleaning agents
- **Class 5**: Stain easily removable with hot water

### Application Recommendations
- **Class 3+**: Recommended for kitchen and dining areas
- **Class 4+**: Ideal for high-maintenance areas
- **Class 5**: Best for commercial food service

## Slip Resistance

Measures friction and sliding resistance for safety applications.

### Test Environments
- **Dry Inner Spaces**: Standard indoor conditions
- **Damp Inner Spaces**: Bathrooms, shower areas
- **Outdoor Areas**: Wet conditions, pool areas

### Safety Applications
- **High COF (Coefficient of Friction)**: Better slip resistance
- **Textured Surfaces**: Enhanced grip in wet conditions
- **Smooth Surfaces**: Lower slip resistance, suitable for dry areas only

## Testing Organizations & Standards

### Primary Testing Bodies
- **ASTM**: American Society for Testing and Materials
- **ISO**: International Organization for Standardization
- **EN**: European Standards

### Key Standards Referenced
- **ASTM C373-88**: Water absorption testing
- **ISO 10545-3**: Water absorption
- **ISO 10545-12**: Frost resistance
- **ISO 10545-14**: Stain resistance
- **EN 99, EN 202, EN 122**: European test methods

## Application Selection Guide

### High-Moisture Areas (Bathrooms, Showers)
- **Water Absorption**: High Dense to Extremely Dense (<3%)
- **Stain Resistance**: Class 3 or higher
- **Slip Resistance**: Enhanced for wet conditions

### High-Traffic Areas (Kitchens, Entrances)
- **PEI Rating**: IV or V
- **Mohs Hardness**: 6 or higher
- **Stain Resistance**: Class 4 or 5

### Outdoor Applications
- **Frost Resistance**: Must be frost resistant
- **Water Absorption**: Extremely Dense (<0.5%)
- **Slip Resistance**: High COF for wet conditions

### Commercial Applications
- **PEI Rating**: V
- **Mohs Hardness**: 7 or higher
- **All resistance properties**: Maximum ratings
