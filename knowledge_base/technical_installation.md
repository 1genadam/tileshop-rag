# Technical Installation Procedures

## Large Format Tile Installation (16"+ tiles)

### Substrate Requirements
- **Flatness Standard**: 1/8" in 10 feet, 1/16" in 2 feet
- **Deflection Limits**: L/360 for ceramic, L/480 for natural stone
- **Surface Preparation**: Must be clean, dry, structurally sound
- **Concrete**: Minimum 28-day cure, properly cured and sealed
- **Plywood**: Minimum 1-1/8" combined thickness over 16" o.c. joists

### Adhesive Specifications
- **Large Format Thinset**: Modified polymer-enhanced mortars
- **Coverage**: 40-50 sq ft per 50 lb bag (1/2" trowel)
- **Pot Life**: Typically 3-4 hours in standard conditions
- **Back-Buttering**: Required for tiles >12" x 12"
- **Coverage Target**: 95% contact for large format installations

### Tools & Equipment
- **Trowels**: 1/2" x 1/2" square notch or larger
- **Leveling Systems**: Clip and wedge systems for lippage control
- **Wet Saw**: 10" blade minimum for clean cuts
- **Rubber Mallet**: For seating tiles without damage
- **Laser Level**: For precise layout and alignment

### Layout Considerations
- **Starting Point**: Center of room or primary focal point
- **Joint Width**: Minimum 1/8" for thermal expansion
- **Pattern Planning**: Avoid small cuts at perimeter
- **Expansion Joints**: Every 20-25 feet in large areas
- **Perimeter Gap**: 1/4" at walls for movement

### Installation Techniques
1. **Thinset Application**: Apply with appropriate trowel, maintain wet time
2. **Back-Buttering**: Apply thinset to tile back for 100% contact
3. **Seating**: Use rubber mallet and beating block
4. **Leveling**: Install leveling clips during set time
5. **Alignment**: Check with straightedge frequently

### Special Considerations
- **Weight**: May require additional structural support
- **Handling**: Use suction cups and proper lifting techniques
- **Cutting**: Requires powerful wet saws with appropriate blades
- **Thermal Movement**: More expansion than smaller tiles
- **Grout Joints**: Cannot be less than tile thickness

## Wall Tile Installation Procedures

### Surface Preparation
- **Drywall**: Prime with appropriate primer-sealer
- **Masonry**: Clean and repair any cracks or voids
- **Existing Tile**: Clean thoroughly, rough sand if glazed
- **Moisture Areas**: Install appropriate waterproof membrane
- **Electrical**: Mark outlet locations precisely

### Adhesive Selection
- **Wall Application**: May use mastic in dry areas
- **Wet Areas**: Use polymer-modified thinset only
- **Natural Stone**: Use white or light-colored adhesive
- **Glass Tile**: Use specialized glass tile adhesive
- **Metal Tile**: Use appropriate bonding agent

### Layout Planning
- **Horizontal Reference**: Level line at desired height
- **Vertical Reference**: Plumb line from room center
- **Pattern**: Plan to avoid narrow cuts at ceiling
- **Focal Points**: Center on windows, vanities, or features
- **Outlets**: Plan cuts for clean electrical box fits

### Installation Sequence
1. **Bottom Row**: Install temporary support ledger
2. **First Tile**: Set at intersection of reference lines
3. **Working Method**: Complete sections before moving
4. **Spacers**: Use appropriate size for joint width
5. **Cleaning**: Remove excess adhesive immediately

### Wall-Specific Techniques
- **Gravity Considerations**: Work in sections to prevent sagging
- **Support Systems**: Use temporary ledgers for heavy tiles
- **Outlet Cuts**: Use hole saw or tile nippers for precision
- **Corner Treatments**: Use bullnose or appropriate trim
- **Top Row**: Install ceiling trim or edge treatment

## Linear Shower Drain Installation

### Planning Requirements
- **Slope**: 1/4" per foot minimum toward drain
- **Drain Location**: Typically opposite shower entrance
- **Length**: Available in 24", 32", 48", 60" lengths
- **Grate Options**: Various designs and materials available
- **Waterproofing**: Critical for proper installation

### Pre-Installation Preparation
- **Rough Plumbing**: Install drain body before floor pour
- **Slope Creation**: Build proper slope to drain with concrete
- **Waterproof Membrane**: Apply over entire shower floor
- **Flange Integration**: Properly seal drain flange to membrane

### Installation Steps
1. **Test Fit**: Verify drain fits properly in opening
2. **Adhesive**: Apply appropriate waterproof adhesive
3. **Set Drain**: Level and properly position drain body
4. **Seal**: Apply waterproof sealant around edges
5. **Test**: Flood test before tile installation

### Tile Layout Around Drain
- **Linear Pattern**: Align tiles parallel to drain length
- **Full Tile**: Plan layout to avoid small cuts at drain
- **Slope Maintenance**: Ensure tile maintains proper slope
- **Cutting**: Use wet saw for precise drain edge cuts
- **Sealing**: Caulk between tile and drain with matching color

### Waterproofing Integration
- **Membrane Overlap**: Properly overlap membrane at drain
- **Sealant Application**: Use appropriate waterproof sealants
- **Flood Testing**: Test before final installation
- **Inspection**: Check all connections and seals

## Thinset and Adhesive Selection Guide

### Thinset Types
**Unmodified Thinset**:
- Basic cement-based mortar
- Requires mixing with water only
- Best for basic ceramic tile applications
- Lower cost option

**Modified Thinset**:
- Contains polymer additives
- Improved bond strength and flexibility
- Required for porcelain and large format tiles
- Better water resistance

**Rapid Setting Thinset**:
- Fast cure time (2-4 hours)
- Good for quick turnaround projects
- Higher cost but time savings
- Shorter working time

### Mastic Adhesives
**Organic Mastic**:
- Ready-to-use organic adhesive
- Good for wall applications in dry areas
- Not suitable for floors or wet areas
- Easier application than thinset

**Special Purpose Mastics**:
- Glass tile mastic for transparent tiles
- Natural stone mastic for sensitive stones
- High-temperature mastic for fireplaces

### Selection Criteria
- **Tile Type**: Porcelain requires modified thinset
- **Application**: Floor vs wall installation
- **Environment**: Wet vs dry areas
- **Substrate**: Concrete, wood, existing tile
- **Timeline**: Standard vs rapid setting needs

## Trowel Selection and Application

### Trowel Types and Uses
**1/4" x 1/4" Square Notch**:
- Mosaic tiles up to 4" x 4"
- Wall applications with small tiles
- Thin adhesive application

**1/4" x 3/8" Square Notch**:
- 4" x 4" to 8" x 8" tiles
- Most common residential applications
- Good for ceramic and small porcelain

**3/8" x 3/8" Square Notch**:
- 8" x 8" to 12" x 12" tiles
- Medium format applications
- Slightly thicker adhesive bed

**1/2" x 1/2" Square Notch**:
- 12" x 12" and larger tiles
- Large format and natural stone
- Maximum adhesive thickness

**V-Notch Trowels**:
- 3/16" V-notch for mosaics
- Creates ridged adhesive pattern
- Good for irregular tile backs

### Application Techniques
1. **Combing**: Hold trowel at 45-degree angle
2. **Direction**: Comb in straight lines, same direction
3. **Coverage**: Cover only area that can be tiled in 15-20 minutes
4. **Ridges**: Maintain consistent ridge height
5. **Collapse**: Check that ridges collapse fully under tile

### Quality Control
- **Coverage Check**: Remove tile to verify 80-95% contact
- **Ridge Collapse**: Ensure ridges flatten completely
- **Working Time**: Don't exceed adhesive open time
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform ridge patterns
- **Clean Tools**: Keep trowel clean for consistent application
