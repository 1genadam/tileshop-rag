### Substrate Requirements
**Concrete Substrates**:
- Thinset preferred for strong mechanical bond
- Surface preparation critical for adhesion
- Moisture testing recommended

**Wood Substrates**:
- Modified thinset for movement accommodation
- Proper deflection limits essential
- Moisture barrier considerations

**Existing Tile**:
- Surface preparation required
- Bonding agents may be needed
- Compatibility testing recommended

### Tile Type Compatibility
**Natural Stone**:
- White or light-colored thinset to prevent staining
- Non-acidic formulations to protect stone
- Appropriate for stone's absorption characteristics

**Porcelain Tiles**:
- Modified thinset for low-porosity bonding
- Enhanced adhesion properties required
- Large format considerations

**Glass Tiles**:
- Specialized glass tile adhesives
- Translucent formulations to prevent show-through
- Specific application techniques

## Color Selection Strategy

### Thinset Color Options
**White Thinset**:
- Preferred for light tiles and grout
- Prevents color bleeding through light materials
- Clean appearance with white and light-colored installations
- Essential for natural stone and glass applications

**Gray Thinset**:
- Recommended for darker tiles and grout
- Cost-effective for most ceramic applications
- Good general-purpose option
- Acceptable for most porcelain installations

### Selection Priority
1. **Functional Suitability**: Performance requirements first
2. **Color Coordination**: Secondary to functional needs
3. **Aesthetic Impact**: Consider show-through potential
4. **Cost Considerations**: Balance performance with budget
