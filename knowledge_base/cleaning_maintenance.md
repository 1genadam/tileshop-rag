# Tile Cleaning & Maintenance Guide

## Grout Cleaning & Maintenance

### Cleaning Supplies
- Rubber gloves and knee pads
- Vacuum/broom
- Sponge and grout brush/toothbrush
- **DIY Solution**: 1/2 cup baking soda + 1/4 cup hydrogen peroxide + 1 tablespoon dish soap
- **Commercial**: Specialized grout cleaner

### Cleaning Process
1. **Prepare**: Sweep/vacuum, wipe shower tiles with hot water
2. **Apply**: Test solution on small area, apply cleaning solution
3. **Scrub**: Use firm-bristled brush, work in small areas, firm pressure
4. **Rinse**: Wipe with damp cloth, rinse with clean water, dry thoroughly

**Pro Tip**: "Apply grout sealer as needed after deep cleaning to protect from stains and moisture"

## Porcelain Tile Cleaning

### Cleaning Supplies
- Soft-bristle broom or vacuum (avoid beater bar)
- Mop and sponge
- Specialized tile cleaner
- Optional: Vinegar, baking soda
- Rubber gloves

### Floor Cleaning Process
1. **Daily**: Sweep or vacuum with soft-bristle attachment
2. **Weekly**: Clean with warm water using soft mop
3. **Deep Clean**: Use specialized tile cleaning product for tough areas

### Shower Cleaning Process
1. **Daily**: Wipe down and dry tile after each use
2. **Weekly**: Clean with pH-neutral tile cleaner
3. **Monthly Deep Clean**:
   - Specialized tile cleaner
   - Water and white vinegar solution
   - Baking soda paste for tough stains

### Key Precautions
- **"Do not use abrasive cleaners, pads or brushes"**
- Rinse thoroughly after cleaning
- Dry surfaces after cleaning

## Marble Tile Cleaning

### Special Considerations
- **Acid Sensitivity**: Avoid acidic cleaners that can "etch the marble"
- **Gentle Approach**: Use mild dish soap or commercial stone tile cleaner
- **Immediate Drying**: Prevent water spots and mineral deposits

### Floor Cleaning Process
1. Sweep or vacuum to remove loose dirt
2. Use mild dish soap or commercial stone tile cleaner
3. Use damp (not soaking) mop
4. Rinse thoroughly and dry immediately with soft towels

### Shower Cleaning Process
1. Use warm water with mild dish soap or pH-neutral cleaner
2. Spray surfaces and let sit briefly
3. Wipe from top to bottom with microfiber cloth
4. Rinse thoroughly
5. Dry with squeegee or soft towel

### Marble Maintenance
- **Daily**: Squeegee tiles after each shower
- **Periodic**: Apply marble sealer as recommended
- **Prevention**: Clean spills immediately, prevent soap scum buildup
- **Water Management**: Address hard water deposits promptly

## Mosaic Tile Special Considerations

### Installation Factors Affecting Cleaning
- **Mesh Backing**: Consider grout joint spacing for cleaning access
- **Spacing**: 1/8" expansion gaps require careful cleaning attention
- **Joint Size**: Smaller joints may require specialized cleaning tools

### Grout Requirements for Mosaics
- **Consistency**: "Peanut butter" texture for proper application
- **Application**: 45-degree angle, diagonal strokes
- **Timing**: 15-30 minutes before excess removal
- **Curing**: 24-72 hours full drying time
- **Sealing**: Apply grout sealer after complete drying

## Grout Selection for Maintenance

### Cement-Based Grout (Most Common)
**Sanded Grout**:
- For joints 1/8" or larger
- Best for porcelain and ceramic tiles
- Requires regular sealing

**Unsanded Grout**:
- For joints under 1/8"
- Ideal for delicate tiles (glass, marble)
- Smoother texture, easier cleaning

### Specialized Grouts (Lower Maintenance)
**Epoxy Grout**:
- Best for high-moisture areas
- More expensive but lower maintenance
- Stain and moisture resistant

**Furan Resin Grout**:
- Industrial/chemical environments
- Maximum resistance properties

### Maintenance Considerations by Grout Type
- **Cement-based**: Seal regularly, more frequent cleaning needed
- **Epoxy**: Lower maintenance, more chemical resistant
- **Flexible/Caulk**: Use for movement areas, replace periodically
