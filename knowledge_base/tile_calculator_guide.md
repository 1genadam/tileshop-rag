# Tile Calculator & Project Planning Guide

## Room Measurement & Calculation

### Basic Room Measurement
**Standard Formula**: Length × Width = Square Footage
**Example**: 10 ft × 12 ft = 120 sq ft

### Complex Room Shapes
**L-Shaped Rooms**: Break into rectangles, calculate separately, add together
**Curved Areas**: Use approximation or professional measurement
**Alcoves & Nooks**: Include in total calculation

### Areas to Subtract
- **Cabinets**: Permanent fixtures (don't tile underneath)
- **Appliances**: Built-in dishwashers, permanent islands
- **Tubs/Showers**: For floor projects, subtract shower area
- **Doorways**: Large openings (small thresholds include in total)

### Areas to Include
- **Under Removable Appliances**: Refrigerators, stoves (for continuity)
- **Doorway Transitions**: Small threshold areas
- **Partial Spaces**: Areas around toilets, pedestal sinks

## Tile Coverage Calculations

### Box Coverage Rates (From Database)
**Coverage Examples**:
- Small Subway (3x6"): ~10.76 sq ft per box
- Standard 12x12": ~15-20 sq ft per box  
- Large Format 24x24": ~15-16 sq ft per box
- Mosaic Sheets: ~10-12 sq ft per box

### Waste Factor Guidelines
**Standard Waste**: 10-15% additional
**Complex Layouts**: 15-20% additional
**Diagonal/Herringbone**: 20-25% additional
**Natural Stone**: 15-20% (due to variations)

### Coverage Calculation Process
1. **Measure Room**: Calculate total square footage
2. **Subtract Fixed Items**: Remove uncovered areas
3. **Add Waste Factor**: Multiply by 1.10-1.25 depending on complexity
4. **Divide by Box Coverage**: Total needed ÷ sq ft per box
5. **Round Up**: Always round up to complete boxes

## Tile Calculator Examples

### Example 1: Standard Bathroom Floor
**Room**: 8 ft × 10 ft = 80 sq ft
**Subtract**: Vanity cabinet (2 ft × 4 ft = 8 sq ft)
**Net Area**: 80 - 8 = 72 sq ft
**Waste Factor**: 72 × 1.15 = 82.8 sq ft needed
**Tile Choice**: 12x12" tile, 15 sq ft per box
**Boxes Needed**: 82.8 ÷ 15 = 5.52 → **6 boxes** (rounded up)

### Example 2: Kitchen Backsplash
**Wall Area**: 8 ft long × 2 ft high = 16 sq ft
**Windows/Outlets**: Subtract 2 sq ft
**Net Area**: 16 - 2 = 14 sq ft
**Waste Factor**: 14 × 1.15 = 16.1 sq ft needed
**Tile Choice**: 3x6" subway, 10.76 sq ft per box
**Boxes Needed**: 16.1 ÷ 10.76 = 1.49 → **2 boxes** (rounded up)

### Example 3: Large Format Living Room
**Room**: 20 ft × 15 ft = 300 sq ft
**Subtract**: Kitchen island (4 ft × 8 ft = 32 sq ft)
**Net Area**: 300 - 32 = 268 sq ft
**Waste Factor**: 268 × 1.20 = 321.6 sq ft (20% for large format)
**Tile Choice**: 24x24", 16 sq ft per box
**Boxes Needed**: 321.6 ÷ 16 = 20.1 → **21 boxes** (rounded up)

## Installation Material Calculator

### Grout Calculations (Based on Tile Size)

#### Subway Tile (3x6") with 1/8" Joints
**Sanded Grout Coverage**: 105-115 sq ft per 25 lb bag
**Example**: 100 sq ft bathroom = 1 bag of grout (minimum)
**Recommendation**: Order 2 bags for larger projects

#### Large Format (12x12"+) with 3/16" Joints
**Sanded Grout Coverage**: 115-140+ sq ft per 25 lb bag
**Example**: 200 sq ft = 2 bags recommended
**Buffer**: Always have extra bag for repairs

#### Mosaic (1/8" joints)
**Unsanded Grout Coverage**: 40-75 sq ft per 25 lb bag
**Higher Usage**: More joint lines require more grout
**Example**: 50 sq ft mosaic = 1-2 bags depending on joint density

### Thinset Calculations
**Standard Coverage**: 95-115 sq ft per 50 lb bag
**Large Format Tiles**: May require more due to back-buttering
**Wall Applications**: Typically use less than floor
**Waste Factor**: Order 15-20% extra

### Trim & Transition Calculations
**Linear Foot Measurement**: Measure perimeter needing trim
**Common Locations**:
  - Base trim: Floor perimeter
  - Edge trim: Exposed tile edges
  - Transition strips: Between different flooring
**Standard Lengths**: Most trim sold in 8-12 foot lengths
