## Core NEPQ Framework

**NEPQ = Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questioning**

### The 5-Stage Framework

1. **Connection Stage (5%)**
   - Purpose: Disarm prospects, not alarm them
   - Focus: Put focus on them, off of you
   - Goal: Lower their guard and create curiosity

2. **Engagement Stage (85%)**
   - Situation Questions: Understand current state
   - Problem Awareness Questions: Uncover root problems and emotional impact
   - Solution Awareness Questions: Help them see future state and ideal criteria
   - Consequence Questions: Build urgency by exploring cost of inaction
   - Qualifying Questions: Confirm importance and readiness to change

3. **Transition Stage**
   - Bridge from problem identification to solution presentation

4. **Presentation Stage (10%)**
   - "Present without presenting"
   - Focus only on problems they mentioned

5. **Commitment Stage (5%)**
   - Commitment Questions to confirm fit
   - Move to next steps/purchase decision

### Key Psychological Principles

- **Internal Tension vs External Pressure**: Create internal motivation through questions rather than external pressure
- **Current State vs Objective State**: Build gap between where they are and where they want to be
- **Status Positioning**: Position as expert/authority through detached approach
- **Emotional Decision Making**: People buy 100% on emotion, justify with logic

## The 3-Step Objection Formula

### Step 1: CLARIFY
**Goal**: Understand exactly what the prospect's concern is and why they have it.

**Key Questions**:
- "When you say [repeat their objection], what do you mean by that?"
- "Can I ask where you got that information from?"
- "How did you arrive at thinking that way?"
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What's behind that?"

### Step 2: DISCUSS  
**Goal**: Have a two-way conversation to explore the concern deeper.

**Approach**: 
- Ask follow-up questions to understand the root cause
- Use consequence questions to help them see implications
- Validate their feelings and concerns

### Step 3: DIFFUSE
**Goal**: Help them resolve the concern in their own mind.

**Technique**:
- Get them to persuade themselves
- Use questions that shift focus from objection to outcome
- Help them find solutions to overcome their concerns

## Detailed Objection Responses

### 1. "It's Too Expensive"

**Clarify**: 
"How do you mean by 'it's too expensive'?"

**Common Responses & Follow-ups**:
- If they compare to competitors: "Can I ask how you arrived at that comparison?"
- If budget-related: "Do you feel like the budget you've been given is sufficient to actually solve this problem though?"

**Diffuse**:
"Help me understand - with cost being the most important factor, how does that compare to your company actually getting results and being able to solve the problem?"

### 2. "We Don't Have the Money/Budget"

**Structure**:
1. "That's not a problem. Tell me, if you did have the funds, is this something that would work for you?"
2. Wait for response, then ask: "Why do you feel like it would though?"
3. "I can appreciate that money might be an issue. How do you think you can resolve that so you can [repeat their desired outcome]?"
4. If stuck: "What other avenues do you have to find the funding so you can [desired outcome]?"

**Industry Examples**:
- Home Security: "What other avenues do you have to find the funding to protect your home and family from intruders?"
- Health Coaching: "What other avenues do you have to find the funding to lose the 90 pounds so you can watch your grandkids grow up?"
- Business Consulting: "What other avenues do you have to find the funding to start getting higher quality leads so your salespeople make more sales?"

### 3. "I Need to Think It Over"

**Key Understanding**: This is NOT a real objection - it's a smokescreen.

**Response Structure**:
1. "That's not a problem. What's your timeframe on getting back to me in the next day or two just to see if I'd be available for you?"
2. Book specific appointment (never accept "I'll call you back")
3. "Well, I'm not sure if I'd be randomly available like that. What I can do if you have your calendar handy, I can pull up mine and have you book a specific time with me. That way you don't have to chase me down and vice versa."
4. Before leaving: "Now before I go, what was it that you were wanting to go over in your mind? Just so I know what questions you might have when we talk tomorrow."

### 4. "I Need to Talk to My Spouse/Partner"

**Two Possible Reasons**:
1. They don't feel urgency (need better questioning)
2. It's truly logistical

**Response**:
1. "That's not a problem. How does your spouse feel about you [repeat their desired outcome]?"
2. "What will you do though if you go to them and they don't want you to get the funds so you can [desired outcome]?"
3. "If they don't let you get the funds so you can [outcome], how will you be able to [outcome]?"
4. "Why look at doing this now? Like why not push it down the road like [unsuccessful people in their situation] would?"

### 5. "Can You Send Me Information/Quote?"

**Early in Call Response**:
"Yeah, that's not a problem. What is it that you were hoping to see from [quote/information]?"

Then: "I understand. It might make sense before I email the quote if I understood a little bit more about who you're using for [their current situation] just to see if we could even help you because maybe you don't even need us at all."

**End of Call Response**:
"What I can do is put together [information/quote] for you. Now let's assume we get you the quote and we're able to meet your needs to solve the problem you mentioned. What do you see as the next step from there?"

### 6. "Can You Send Me References?"

**Response**:
1. "That's not a problem. What would you like to ask them when you call?"
2. "When do you plan on calling them so I can let them know you might be available?"
3. "What I can do is reach out to them. Assuming the clients say good things about how we solve the same problems your company has, at that point where do you think we should go from there?"

**Warning**: Never send references without a commitment on next steps.

### 7. "I Need to Talk to the Board"

**Response**:
1. "That's not a problem. How does your board feel about you guys being able to solve this problem so you can [desired outcome]?"
2. "What happens if you go to the board and they don't want you to get the extra funding? How would you ever be able to [desired outcome]?"
3. "Would it help if we had you introduce us to the board so we can go over some of the issues you mentioned and how we could possibly solve those?"

### 8. "I Don't Know What I Need to Improve"

**Response**:
"Well, if you really thought about it, what do you feel like it would be?"

**Key**: Use "feel" instead of "think" to engage emotions rather than logic.

### 9. "I'll Get Back to You"

**Understanding**: 99% won't call back - this is a smokescreen.

**Response** (Same as "Think It Over"):
1. "That's not a problem. What's your timeframe on getting back to me in the next few days to see if I'd be available for you?"
2. Book specific time
3. Before leaving: "What was it that you wanted to go over in your mind? Just so I know what questions you have when we talk on Monday."

### 10. "I Want to Compare Prices with Another Company"

**Response**:
"That's not a problem. So let's say this other company coming in tomorrow also meets your criteria, including the price. How would you then decide what to do?"

**Purpose**: This reveals their decision-making criteria and hot buttons that will help you close the deal.

### 11. "I'm Not Interested"

**Early Call Response**:
"I didn't mean to offend you. I'm not quite sure we could even help you yet. We'd have to understand more about what you're using for [ABC] just to see if we can even help you in the first place. And if we can't, we can just end the call. Or if you find that we can possibly help, we can continue the conversation if you want to. Are you with me on that?"

### 12. "I've Never Done This Before / That's More Money Than I've Ever Spent"

**For High-Ticket Items**:
1. "How do you mean by that exactly?"
2. "So I'm assuming you understand when you want to acquire the right skill sets to be able to [achieve goal], it's going to require capital to put into that so you can [get results] and really minimize your risk."
3. "How much funding do you think most people put into acquiring those type of advanced skills so that they can [achieve goal]?"
4. "Is it more risky to get the funding to [get solution] and [achieve goal], or is it more risky for you to do nothing at all and your [problem] stays exactly the same?"

### 13. "I Don't Want to Go Into Debt"

**Response**:
"Can I make a suggestion on that topic? I'm a big Dave Ramsey fan, and he always talks about there are two types of debt. There's consumer debt, and then there's business debt. Are you familiar with the difference?"

**Follow-up**:
"Consumer debt is where you buy things that don't make you any money - clothes, electronics, etc. That's bad debt. Good debt according to business owners and investors is taking capital and injecting it into a business so you can start it and grow it and make money. Without the capital, how would you ever be able to start your own business so you can [desired outcome]?"

### 14. "It Sounds Too Good to Be True"

**Response**:
1. "Would you like us to make it harder for you?"
2. "That saying 'if it sounds too good to be true it probably is' - where do you think that originally came from? Someone who was extremely wealthy or somebody who was poor?"
3. "So if you take advice from poor people, what type of financial results do you think you'll get?"
4. "Do you want to change that?"

### 15. "Can You Give This to Me for Free and I'll Pay You Back?"

**Response**:
1. "How can you understand? How would the owners be willing to give away something that gives clients [those type of skill levels] for free?"
2. "Can I make a suggestion? Have you ever considered that that way of thinking - where someone should just give you something extremely valuable for free - has kept you financially exactly where you're at in your life?"
3. "How could we force someone to follow what we teach them and just hope they pay us back? A client could just take all the training and never pay us back."
4. "Is it more risky for you to get the funding to invest in [solution], or is it more risky for you to do nothing at all and stay in the status quo forever?"

### 16. "We Decided to Go with Someone Else"

**Response**:
"That's not a problem. We appreciate the time we've been able to spend with you. Can I ask you something though before we get off the phone? How would I be able to communicate to you that you might be making a mistake by going with [XYZ company] without you getting upset with me?"

**Purpose**: This reopens the conversation and allows you to clarify their decision and potentially reverse it.

### Questions That Work Universally
- "What do you mean by that?"
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "How did you arrive at that?"
- "What's behind that?"
- "What would you do if [negative consequence]?"
- "How would you be able to [desired outcome] if [obstacle]?"

### Never Do This
- Don't argue with objections
- Don't use logical rebuttals immediately  
- Don't accept "I'll call you back"
- Don't send information without commitment
- Don't present features/benefits as objection responses
- Don't sound desperate or pushy

### Remember
- Objections are concerns, not rejections
- Help them persuade themselves
- The prospect should talk 70%, you 30%
