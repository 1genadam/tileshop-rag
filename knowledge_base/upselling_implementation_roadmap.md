# Upselling Implementation Roadmap - Phase 1

## 🎯 **Strategic Upselling Design: $200→$500 Subway Tile Transformation**

### **Project Objective**
Transform basic subway tile queries into complete project consultations, achieving $200→$500 upselling through intelligent cross-selling and comprehensive project packaging.

### **Current RAG System Analysis:**
**✅ Strengths:**
- Database search capability for subway tiles
- Product categorization and pricing data
- Claude API integration for intelligent responses
- SKU detection and product search logic

**⚠️ Current Limitation:**
- Focuses on finding products, not building complete project packages
- No automatic cross-selling logic for related materials
- Missing project calculation and room sizing

### **Strategic Upselling Flow Design:**

#### **1. Subway Tile Query Detection & Enhancement**
```python
def detect_subway_tile_query(query):
    """Enhanced detection for subway tile opportunities"""
    subway_indicators = ['subway', '3x6', '4x8', 'backsplash', 'bathroom wall', 'kitchen wall']
    project_indicators = ['bathroom', 'kitchen', 'shower', 'backsplash', 'remodel']
    
    # Detect both product interest AND project context
    return {
        'is_subway_query': any(term in query.lower() for term in subway_indicators),
        'project_context': [term for term in project_indicators if term in query.lower()],
        'needs_upselling': True
    }
```

#### **2. Room Size Intelligence & Project Calculator**
```python
def extract_project_scope(query, follow_up=True):
    """Intelligent project scope detection"""
    # Extract room mentions
    room_indicators = {
        'bathroom': {'typical_size': '50-80 sq ft', 'high_moisture': True},
        'kitchen backsplash': {'typical_size': '30-50 sq ft', 'moderate_moisture': True},
        'shower': {'typical_size': '100-150 sq ft walls', 'high_moisture': True}
    }
    
    # If no size mentioned, ask intelligent follow-up questions
    if follow_up:
        return "I'd love to help you create a complete project package! What size area are you tiling? For example, is this for a small bathroom (50 sq ft), large bathroom (80+ sq ft), or kitchen backsplash?"
```

#### **3. Complete Project Package Builder**
```python
def build_complete_project_package(tile_selection, room_size, room_type):
    """Transform $200 tile purchase into $500+ complete project"""
    
    base_tile_cost = calculate_tile_cost(tile_selection, room_size)
    
    # Essential materials (required for installation)
    essential_package = {
        'grout': select_matching_grout(tile_selection),
        'thinset': calculate_thinset_needs(room_size, room_type),  # Double if membrane needed
        'tools': get_essential_tools(tile_selection),
        'spacers': get_appropriate_spacers(tile_selection)
    }
    
    # Application-specific upsells
    if room_type in ['bathroom', 'shower']:
        essential_package.update({
            'waterproofing': 'Backer-lite membrane (wet areas)',
            'thinset_adjustment': 'Double quantity for membrane installation',
            'caulk': '100% silicone caulk (movement areas)',
            'sealer': 'Grout sealer for moisture protection'
        })
    
    # Premium upgrades (upsell opportunities)
    premium_options = {
        'trim_package': select_matching_trim(tile_selection),
        'heated_floor': 'Radiant heating system (if floor application)',
        'professional_tools': 'Euro trowel (universal flexibility)',
        'maintenance_kit': 'Long-term care products'
    }
    
    return calculate_total_package_value(essential_package, premium_options)
```

#### **4. Intelligent Recommendation Engine**
```python
def generate_upselling_response(subway_tiles, project_details):
    """Generate compelling upselling response"""
    
    response_template = f"""
    🏠 **Complete {project_details['room_type'].title()} Project Package**
    
    **Your Selected Subway Tiles:** {subway_tiles['title']}
    - **Base Cost:** ${subway_tiles['total_cost']:.2f} ({project_details['sq_ft']} sq ft)
