# Installation How-To Guides

## Tile Cutting Techniques

### Wet Saw (Most Versatile)
**Best For**: Natural stone, porcelain, ceramic, glass tiles
**Key Features**:
- Water reservoir keeps blade cool
- Smooth, precise cuts
- Requires special blade for glass tiles

**Safety & Technique**:
- "Let the blade come up to speed before you begin"
- "Apply constant pressure as you push the tile through"
- Always use protective ear and eye equipment
- Smooth cut edges with diamond polishing pads at 45-degree angle

### Snap Cutter (Portable Option)
**Best For**: Glass, ceramic, porcelain tiles
**Cannot Cut**: Natural stone
**Technique**:
- "Hold the tile with firm downward pressure"
- "Start your cut at the very edge of the tile"
- "Apply even pressure all the way through"

### Angle Grinder (Limited Use)
**Best For**: Ceramic and porcelain tiles only
**Not Recommended**: Glass or natural stone
**Safety Requirements**:
- Use diamond blade
- Perform cuts outdoors (loud and dusty)
- Wear face mask, ear, and eye protection
- "Pull the grinder toward you in a straight line"

## Tile Laying Process

### Materials Checklist
- **Substrate**: Backer board, membrane
- **Adhesives**: Thinset, epoxy, mastic  
- **Finishing**: Grout, sealer
- **Tools**: Trowel, float, wet saw, spacers, buckets, sponges

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Preparation
- Clean and dry surface thoroughly
- Measure and find room's center point
- Plan layout to avoid small cuts at edges

#### 2. Mixing Thinset
- Follow manufacturer's water-to-powder ratio
- Mix to "peanut butter" consistency
- Let mixture "slake" for 5-10 minutes before use

#### 3. Laying Tile
- Apply thinset with notched trowel at 45-degree angle
- Use spacers between tiles
- Apply firm, even pressure when setting
- Wiggle tiles to break down thinset ridges
- Leave 1/8" between tile and wall for expansion

#### 4. Quality Control
- Check thinset coverage (80-90% of tile back)
- Clean tools daily
- Follow manufacturer's cure times

## Grouting Techniques

### Tool Requirements
- Grout (sanded or unsanded)
- Grout float and shaper
- Three buckets for water
- Sponges and clean cloths
- Grout sealer
- Safety equipment (gloves, glasses, knee pads)

### Grout Selection
**Sanded Grout**:
- For joints wider than 1/8"
- Contains sand to prevent cracking
- Provides sturdy coverage

**Unsanded Grout**:
- For joints less than 1/8"
- Smoother texture, easier application
- Good for vertical surfaces

### Application Process
1. **Surface Prep**: Ensure dry, clean surface, remove old grout if re-grouting
2. **Mix Grout**: Small portions, "peanut butter-like consistency", allow to "slake"
3. **Application**: Use float at 45-degree angle, diagonal strokes, fill joints completely
4. **Cleanup**: Wait 15-30 minutes, use damp sponge, rinse frequently
5. **Finishing**: Let dry 24-48 hours, apply sealer, polish with soft cloth

## Edge Finishing Options

### Bullnose Tile
- Rounded edge tiles for smooth transitions
- Available in matching tile collections
- Installed using thinset mortar

### Pencil Trim
- Thin, elongated tile pieces
- Various materials and shapes available
- Requires careful thinset application in back channel

### Metal Profile Pieces
- Streamlined transition between surfaces
- Different metal tones and finishes
- Install before final tile row, embed part underneath

## Backsplash Installation

### Tool Kit
- Pry bar, hammer, screwdriver
- Tile cutter, notched trowel, margin trowel
- Grout float, caulk gun
- Safety goggles, buckets, sponge, dry cloth

### Installation Sequence
1. **Prep**: Remove outlet covers, cover countertops, clean walls
2. **Optional**: Install backer board for uneven surfaces
3. **Layout**: Dry layout for symmetrical cuts, account for outlets
4. **Install**: Cut tiles, apply adhesive, place with spacers
5. **Finish**: Remove spacers, grout diagonally, clean excess
6. **Final**: "Leave 1/8" expansion gap between counter and tile", caulk gap, seal grout after 24-48 hours

## Tile Repair Techniques

### Cracked Tile Replacement
**Tools**: Painter's tape, utility knife, hammer, chisel, screwdriver, crowbar

**Process**:
1. Tape surrounding tiles for protection
2. Remove grout around damaged tile
3. Break and remove tile from center
4. Remove remaining thinset mortar
5. Install new tile with fresh thinset
6. Let dry overnight, then regrout

### Chipped Tile Repair
**Materials**: Painter's tape, two-part epoxy, color matching kit, sandpaper

**Process**:
1. Tape off chipped area
2. Mix epoxy with matching color
3. Apply epoxy to fill chip
4. Remove tape while epoxy is wet
5. Sand and blend repaired area

**Safety Note**: "Always wear appropriate eye and face coverings when demolishing tile"
