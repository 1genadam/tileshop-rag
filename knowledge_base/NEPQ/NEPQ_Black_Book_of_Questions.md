## Introduction

This book has been 23 years in the making. It's a sales framework built from experience in the trenches, selling in four different industries, built from studies in human behavioral science and lessons learned from the most persuasive figures in history.

It's been tested by sales professionals around the world and has yielded statistically significant results in 161 different industries.

## The New Model of Selling

### The Three Eras of Selling

#### Selling Era #1: Boiler Room Selling
- **Presenting**: Features and benefits pitches
- **Telling Your Story**: Company values, awards, history (prospects don't care)
- **Using External Pressure**: Telling prospects what to believe vs. creating internal tension
- **"Assuming the Sale"**: Making sales a numbers game through force

*Key insight: We are the least persuasive when we tell people things or attempt to dominate them.*

#### Selling Era #2: Consultative Selling
Popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s with methodologies like SPIN Selling.

**The Problem**: Surface-level questions like:
- "What's the #1 challenge you're facing?"
- "What are two things keeping you up at night?"
- "If you waved a magic wand and could solve the problem, what would that look like?"

Result: Logical, surface-level answers when people buy on emotion.

#### Selling Era #3: Dialogue (NEPQ)
**Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questioning**

We are most persuasive when we get others to pull us in and persuade themselves.

**Key Principle**: When prospects come to their own conclusions, they will not only accept them, they will fight for them.

### The NEPQ Distribution Model

**New Model (NEPQ)**:
- 85% Engagement Stage
- 10% Presentation
- 5% Commitment

**Old Model**:
- 50% Presentation
- 30% Closing/Sales Pressure
- 10% Identify Needs
- 10% Build Rapport

## What NEPQ Questions Will Do For You

1. **Help prospects analyze and diagnose their problems** - root causes and personal impact
2. **Engage prospects emotionally** - they feel part of the process
3. **Create internal persuasion** - they tell themselves about their problems
4. **Create value in your expertise** - position you as trusted authority
5. **Help prospects overcome their own concerns** - no more traditional objection handling

**Key Result**: Your prospects will start calling you back and chasing you rather than you chasing them.

## The 5 Stages of NEPQ

### Stage 1: Connection Stage (5%)
**Purpose**: Disarm prospects, not alarm them
- Put focus on them, off of you
- Lower their guard within first 7-12 seconds
- Create curiosity rather than resistance

### Stage 2: Engagement Stage (85%)
**Five sub-stages**:
1. **Situation Questions** - Understand current state
2. **Problem Awareness Questions** - Uncover emotional problems
3. **Solution Awareness Questions** - Help them see future state
4. **Consequence Questions** - Build urgency through cost of inaction
5. **Qualifying Questions** - Confirm importance and readiness

### Stage 3: Transition Stage
Bridge from problem identification to solution presentation using the Transition Formula.

### Stage 4: Presentation Stage (10%)
"Present without presenting" - focus only on their specific problems mentioned in Stage 2.

### Stage 5: Commitment Stage (5%)
Help them commit and take next steps toward purchasing your solution.

## Connection Stage

### Connection Questions - Generic Examples

```
Have you found what you're wanting, or are you still looking for…?

When you talked with ______, what was it that you guys talked about that caused you… to wanna look into this further?

When you saw the ad that was going over _______, what was it they were talking about… that caused you to want to… look into this further?
```

**Important**: Ellipses (…) indicate "Verbal Pauses" - they help you sound unscripted and cause prospects to think deeper.

### Outbound Lead Script

```
Hey [Prospect Name], this is just [Your Name] with [Company].
It looks like you recently responded to an ad on [platform] and asked us to call you… about possibly helping you with [end result]. And I just had a few minutes before my next appointment…

I guess I should start off by asking you, have you found what you're looking for, or are you still looking for [end result]?

[PROSPECT RESPONDS]

And do you know what you're... looking for?

[PROSPECT RESPONDS]

So when you saw the ad, what was it they were going through…that caused you to… wanna look into this further?

[STATUS FRAME]
Now, this call is pretty basic; it's really more for us to find out about what you're using now, what results you're getting, compared to what you might be wanting, to see what that GAP looks like…

And towards the end of the call, if you feel like it... "might be"... what you're looking for, we can talk about "possible" next steps.

Would that help you?
```

### Inbound Lead Script

```
Hey [Prospect Name], this is just [Your Name] with [Company].
It looks like you recently booked on our calendar… about possibly getting help with [problem] so that you can [end result], right?

[PROSPECT RESPONDS]

And what were you hoping to get out of the call with us today, just so we have a better understanding?

[PROSPECT RESPONDS]

So when you went through the ad where XYZ was talking. What was it about what they were saying that caused you to… wanna look into this further?

[STATUS FRAME - same as above]
```

### Industry-Specific Connection Examples

#### Auto Industry (Outbound)
```
Hey [Prospect Name], yea... it's just [Your Name] from [Company].
You had asked us to call you back… it looks like you responded to an ad on Facebook this morning about possibly looking at that… Red 2022 A6 Audi, right?

Yea, we just got that car on a trade-in that you were looking at; what aspects of the car, I guess… caused you to maybe... want to test drive it?

Aww, okay, and do you know what type of vehicle you might be looking for... besides the red Audi… just in case it's already gone… by the time you could get down here to look at it?
```

#### SaaS - For Associations (Inbound)
```
It looks like you booked with us to look at possible outside help with your awards program and automate that process, right?

So when you were talking to [contact name], what was it you guys were going over that caused you to want to look into this further?

[STATUS FRAME]
```

## Engagement Stage

### Situation Questions

**Purpose**: 
1. Help us understand their current situation
2. Help prospect discover problems they might be unaware of

**Generic Examples**:
```
What are you doing now?
What are you using now?
How long have you been…?
What got you involved with…?
Can you walk me through what your process is for...?
How many [X] do you have so I have more context?
```

### Life Insurance Situation Questions Example

#### Scenario 1: No Coverage
```
It doesn't sound like you have life insurance now... do you have any savings, stocks, or like when something does happen to you… like what would be used to pay for the mortgage, the car payments, credit card debt, funeral services, and ALL the BILLS and EXPENSES; what would be used to pay for all that?

Now… would they be forced to pay out of pocket, or… would they have to get a loan and have to pay all the interest and stuff?

And who would be the person responsible for having to like... Go in, sit down, and actually meet the funeral director and have to plan and pay for everything?
```

### Problem Awareness Questions

**Purpose**: Understand real problems, root causes, and emotional impact

**The "Two Truths" Technique**:
```
So, to me, it sounds like things are going 100% perfect for you. Is there anything you would change about your [present situation], results you're getting from that if you... if you could?

[IF THEY SAY NO]
So I'm curious: what is it about your [situation] that you don't like?

Why would you change that?

Why is that important to you now, though?
```

**Precision Probing Sequence**:
```
Tell me more… about that? (curious tone)

How long has that been going on?

In what way, though?

Has that had… has that had… an impact on you? (verbal pace this out)

Can you give me a specific example so I can understand this better?
```

### Financial Services Problem Awareness Example
```
So, with the retirement strategies you have now… do you... do you LIKE… the returns you have been getting?

[When they say "not 100% perfect"]
Not 100% perfect? What do you like about it?

So, to me, it sounds like things are going 100% perfect for you. What would you change if you could?
```

### Solution Awareness Questions

**Two Parts**:
1. What they've done in the past to solve problems
2. What their future looks like once problems are solved

**Part 1 - Past Actions**:
```
Before we started talking today, were you out there looking for [solution] so you can [result]?

What's prevented you from doing that in the past?

[If they tried something]
What did you do?
How did that work out?
What kind of results did you get from it?
What do you think held you back from having success…?
```

**Criteria Question Sequence**:
```
Let's do this… just to make sure that what we're doing could actually help you… besides [benefit #1] and [benefit #2], what would you actually be looking for in [your product/service]?

Like what would be your ideal criteria?

Is there anything else you want?

Can I ask why that's important to you… now though?
```

**Part 2 - Future State**:
```
How would it be different, though? You being able to [what they want]. How would your life/business be… Maybe different than it is now?

How do you see the benefits of actually solving this problem?

What would it do for you personally, though?

How would that make you… feel though?
```

### Consequence Questions

**Purpose**: Build urgency by exploring cost of inaction

**Generic Examples**:
```
What if you don't do anything about this problem [specific problem], and your situation gets even worse? (challenging tone)

What are you going to do if nothing changes, if you keep using/doing [current situation] for the next [timeframe] and nothing changes?

Have you thought about what would happen if you don't do anything about this?

Do you want to have to go through all of that… if you… if you didn't have to?
```

### Industry-Specific Consequence Examples

#### Solar (Residential)
```
What happens if you don't do anything about this… they keep raising your rates every year like they have… and now you're 75-80 years old… still having to pay your bill every month… but the bill is more than three times what it is now... and now you're on a limited income/social security... How would you pay for it… at that point?

Okay, but for you… Why look at going solar now? Why not push it down the road and keep paying the rate hikes like a lot of people who don't know anything about solar do?

Do you want… to have to keep being FORCED to pay the RATE HIKES… if you… if you didn't have to?
```

#### Dental Implants
```
What happens if you don't do anything about this, though… you keep losing the bone density in your jaw… and now you can't even get implants?

Do you want to keep living with that pain in your mouth… if you… if you didn't have to?
```

## Transition Stage

### The Transition Formula

```
Because you know how you said… [Repeat back what they said they wanted]
And because of that, it's making you feel… [Repeat back emotional impact]
I think you mentioned a little bit… Stressed sometimes…
Based on what you told me… What we are doing could/would actually work for you…
```

## Presentation Stage

### "Present Without Presenting"

**Key Rules**:
1. Only 10-15% of entire sale
2. Focus solely on problems they mentioned in Engagement Stage
3. Use the 3-Step Presentation Formula
4. Ask 8-12 "Checking for Agreement" questions

### The 3-Step Presentation Formula

**Step 1**: Problem Identification
```
One of the biggest problems that people have when they come to us is they don't know how to/don't understand how to/having issues with [their main issue/challenge]...

Which causes them to [consequences]...
```

**Step 2**: Solution Explanation
```
So the way we solve that for our clients like you is we [how your product/service solves this part of the problem]...
```

**Step 3**: Benefit Connection
```
And what they mean to you is [advantages and benefits of what it will do for them once it's solved]...
```

### Checking for Agreement Questions
```
Do you see how that works?
Are we on the same page?
What are your thoughts on that?
Are you with me on this?
Do you see how that could help you?
Any questions about that?
How do you see that helping you the most?
```

### Presentation Bridges

**One-Call Close**:
```
With your permission, I can go over a few things that we would be able to do for you to help you with your situation and solve those problems [repeat the actual problems]. Would that help you?
```

**Two-Call Close/Proposal**:
```
Alright, so good first call that helps me better understand your situation and the challenges you guys are going through compared to where you want to be…

Really, the next step is, if it's appropriate... We would go back and put together a proposal for you with different options on what we could do for you to solve all of these problems and help you [repeat back what they said they wanted]. Would that help you?
```

## Commitment Stage

### Commitment Questions

```
Do you feel like this could be the… answer for you?

What specific parts/aspects of what we went over today do you feel... are going to really help you the most?

Why do you feel it would, though?

Do you feel like this is something you can have/do that will get you where you want to go?
```

### Generic Commitment Close

```
Well, it looks like we covered what you're possibly looking for in [solution].
Really, the next step is we would make some type of arrangement for you [payment terms], you can use a credit or debit card, invoice, wire transfer then at that point we would [next steps] so that you can [desired outcome].

Would that be appropriate, or how... Would you like to proceed from here?
```

### Industry-Specific Commitment Examples

#### Real Estate Agent (Seller)
```
Do you feel like this marketing plan we discussed to sell the home… would be the answer for you?

Hold on, why do you feel like it is, though?

Well, I don't really have anything else to go over with you. It looks like we've covered the basis of what you are looking for to sell your home… really the next step would be… is we would have you fill out the listing agreement and arrange for the photographer to come out to take pictures of your home… and then start the listing on the MLS so we can get it sold quickly for you.

Would that be appropriate?
```

#### Final Expense Insurance
```
Which one of those would you... lean towards? (soft tone)

How come that one, just so I understand?

Does this feel like it's what you're looking for… to take that burden off your kids' shoulders… so they're not responsible… for having to pay… for all those expenses when you pass?

That makes sense… well, the first step is to make sure we could even get you qualified. I can get that pulled up here. I've got your [confirm details]. Is that correct?
```

## Bonus Section

### Cold Calling Introductions

#### Generic Cold Call Opening
```
Hey [Name], this is just [Your Name]. I was wondering if you could… help me out for a moment?

Well, I'm not quite sure who I should be talking to; I called/stopped by to see who would be responsible for looking at any possible hidden gaps in your [area] that could be causing you to [problem]?

Who should I be talking to about that?
```

#### If They're Aggressive
```
Oh, I apologize if I offended you. What I do is… you know how… [then go into your personalized intro]
```

### Personalized Intro - 30 Second Commercial

```
Well, you know how a lot of people/companies sometimes get frustrated with [problem 1], [problem 2], and [problem 3]?

Well, what I do is, I help people/companies like that with [solution 1], [solution 2] and [solution 3].

Does that resonate with you/your company or something you might be experiencing?
```

Tell me, what's driving the need to change your situation now, though?

```

### NEPQ Decision-Making Questions (B2B)

```
Can you walk me through your company's decision-making process… when it comes to solving problems like this?

Who else besides you would be involved in approving the funding/budget to solve this?

Can you tell me how the funding for this project will be determined?

Let's suppose you meet with all these other companies, and let's say they all meet your criteria… can solve the same problems like we can… and the pricing is somewhat similar… How would you then decide who to go with at that point?
```

### NEPQ Qualifying Questions

Are you prepared... to change your situation so you can [what they wanted]?
It sounds like you're frustrated with [what they don't like]. So, if you could get what you want, how important is it for you to do that? Why now?
```

### Common Objection Responses

#### "Send Me a Proposal/Quote" (Early in Call)
```
Oh yea, for sure. What is it that you're hoping to see from the proposal?

Awww.. I understand. Now, It might make sense FOR YOU… before I sent a proposal if I understood a little bit more about who you're using for XYZ/situation just to see if we could even help… because you might not even need us.

For example, what type of… [start asking situation questions]
```

#### "Send Information to My Email"
```
Yea, I can do that for sure, now, just so I can put together the right information for you. What exactly are you looking for?

[After engagement stage]
Okay, good first call, that helps us better understand what's going on. What I can do, if you'd like, is send you the info about how we could solve XYZ problems you mentioned.

Now, let's suppose you and the firm go through the details we sent over and see if it fits into what you are looking for. What would you want… the next step to be?
```

#### "Can You Call Me Back?"
```
That's not a problem. What I can do if it helps you… I will give you my number, and you'll have to call me back later today to see if I would be available for you. Would that help?

My number is [XXX-XXX-XXXX]. What's your timeframe on getting back to me today just to see if I would even be in the office for you?
```

**Alternative: NEPQ Calendar Commitment**
```
Well, possibly, it might be harder to randomly get a hold of me with my schedule. Here's what I can do, though: If you have your calendar handy, I could pull out mine so you can book a specific time with me; that way, you don't have to chase me down and vice versa… Would that work for you?
```

### How to Ask for Referrals

#### The Right Way
```
I appreciate the opportunity to be able to help you. Can I ask you... in your mind, how do you feel we've been able to help you the most?

[PROSPECT RESPONDS]

With that in mind, who do you know that might be struggling with [specific problem you solved]?

[PROSPECT GIVES NAME]

Can you tell me a little bit more about this person and why you feel I could help them, though?

[SETUP]
Well, how do you think it would be best to approach them?

Do you feel like you should communicate to him first that I will be calling, though? What do you think you should say?

Can I make a suggestion? What if you talked about some of the challenges you had and that he's having right now and how we've been able to solve those? Would that be more helpful to him?
```

#### Calling Referrals
```
Hi, is this [Name]? This is [Your Name]. A mutual friend/business associate of yours, [Referrer], suggested I call you, as I recently helped her with [specific problem], which was causing them to [consequence], and she mentioned to me that you might be experiencing the same challenges with that.

Is this an appropriate time to talk?
```

**Key**: Use "might be" experiencing - never assume they have the same problems.

### NEPQ Funding/Budgeting Questions

```
Could you go over your funding/budgetary process when it comes to solving problems like this?

Just to see if I could help you, what funding/budgetary parameters are you working with?

What obstacles would you possibly encounter when trying to get financial approval to solve XYZ problem?

Tell me, if you did have the funding/budget/money, is this something that would work for you?

I can appreciate that money might be an issue based on what you told me. How do you think you can resolve that… so you can find the funding/funds so that you can [what they want]?
```

### The Proposal Process

#### Rule #1
Never give a prospect a proposal without understanding what their problems are, and whether they have the funds/funding/money/budget to solve the problem.

#### Rule #2
Your proposals should lay out the key 2-3 problems they told you during the Engagement Stage and the key 2-3 objectives they want to accomplish.

#### Three Options Structure
Every proposal should provide 3 options:
1. **Option 1**: Basic, lower-priced option (still profitable)
2. **Option 2**: Middle-of-the-road core offering (where most prospects fall)
3. **Option 3**: High-priced premium choice

### Customer Retention Questions

```
How do you feel we are helping you the most? Why though? What type of changes do you feel we could make to help you achieve even greater results?

What objectives would you like to see us help you get to within the next quarter/year?

How could we make your life easier? Tell me more…

Would you be opposed to giving me some advice on how we could do better for you?
```

## Key Principles Summary

1. **85/10/5 Rule**: 85% Engagement, 10% Presentation, 5% Commitment
2. **Internal vs External**: Create internal tension, not external pressure
3. **Problem-Finding**: Be a problem-finder, not just problem-solver
4. **Verbal Pacing**: Use ellipses (…) for intentional pauses
5. **Tonality Matters**: Curious, concerned, challenging tones as appropriate
6. **Status Positioning**: Come across as detached expert, not needy salesperson
7. **Current vs Objective State**: Build gap between where they are and want to be
8. **Consequence Building**: Help them see cost of inaction to create urgency
9. **Self-Persuasion**: Get prospects to persuade themselves rather than you persuading them
10. **Customize Everything**: Tailor all questions and presentations to their specific situation

## Success Metrics

**You know NEPQ is working when**:
- Prospects open up emotionally about problems
- They start asking questions about your solution
- They defend why they need to change (during consequence questions)
- They give specific examples of problems
- They discuss internal decision-making process
- They call you back instead of you chasing them

**Remember**: The goal is to help prospects discover their own problems and solutions, making them feel like the decision to change is entirely their own idea.
